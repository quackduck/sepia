# Sepia
A minimal interpreted programming language.

## Running examples
You can run some of the examples by building Sepia yourself (it's meant to be a completely minimal language, so compiling itself takes <0.5s.) and running `./sepia examples/factorial.sp`.

You can also grab the latest Sepia release from [the Releases page](https://github.com/rishiosaur/sepia/tags); just move it into the same directory that you've cloned `rishiosaur/sepia` to.
